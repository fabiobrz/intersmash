ws-bootable-jar-example
=======================

This module provides a simple POC webservice's jaxws application that is built as a bootable jar consisting of Wildfly and the jaxws war file, and then deployed to OpenShift, and tested.

The jaxws module builds 2 archives, the webservice's war file and a bootable jar to be run on OpenShift

This module demonstrates building a fresh (relatively current) version of Wildfly using Galleon for inclusion in the bootable jar, as compared to pulling a pre-existing Wildfly image from a public repository.  The process enables the user to build a most currently version of Wildfly for testing.   

Module, demos, is not declared in intersmash's root pom.xml file. This example must be run from directory, demos.  The user will also require a test.properties file with the appropriate OpenShift reference and configuration information.  The test can be run with cmd.

   mvn test -pl ws-bootable-jar-example/ -amd -Dtest=SoapWildflyBootableOpenShiftJarTest \
     -Dxtf.test_properties.path=/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/test.properties

or if test.properties resides in the demos directory cmd,

   mvn test -pl ws-bootable-jar-example/ -amd -Dtest=SoapWildflyBootableOpenShiftJarTest
