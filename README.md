# Intersmash - Run your cloud-native tests with Java!

Intersmash is a Java library that will make it easy to provision and execute (complex) test scenarios on OpenShift.

Either you work as an enterprise application developer, runtime components engineer, quality engineer or DevOps, 
Intersmash helps Java developers to prototype and test complex interoperability scenarios on cloud-native environments 
and platforms, most notably on OpenShift (and on Kubernetes as well, shortly :) ).

Through a convenient set of annotations and APIs, Intersmash provides the developer with tools to describe and deploy 
services, and to manage their life-cycle orchestration directly, from the test class.

## Usage

Add dependencies to your project configuration, e.g.: Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.intersmash</groupId>
    <artifactId>intersmash-tools-core</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jboss.intersmash</groupId>
      <artifactId>intersmash-tools-provisioners</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The following is an example of a test:

```java
@Intersmash({
        // 1
        @Service(OpenShiftInfinispanApp.class),
        @Service(OpenShiftWildflyApp.class)
    }
)
public class SampleTest {
    @ServiceUrl(OpenShiftWildflyApp.class) // 2
    private String wildflyRouteUrl;

    @ServiceProvisioner(OpenShiftWildflyApp.class) // 3
    private OpenShiftProvisioner wildflyOpenShiftProvisioner;

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // Do your thing.
    }
}
```
* **1:** The applications/products used in the test are listed as `@Service` items within the `@Intersmash` annotation.
  Each of the mentioned classes will provide the platform-specific configuration for the given application/product.
  You may deploy application on some server (Wildfly), setup services that don't require a deployment, or just deploy a
  database.
* **2:** To inject information about the application into the test, the tooling layer provides some annotations.
  The application class needs to match the one which is configured in the classes in point *#1*.
  `@ServiceUrl` provides support to inject into String or URL type field.
  Beware, some applications (e.g. DB running on OpenShift) might not provide `@ServiceUrl` as there is no route to them
  created.
* **3:** Should you need control over platform-specific actions, you can also inject a provisioner via the `@ServiceProvisioner` annotation.
  This will enable you to, for example, scale your deployment up and down.

In the most common use cases, you'll just have to implement the correct `Application` 
interface and pass the class via `@Service` annotation, it's a task for the framework to choose a suitable 
Provisioner implementation (an exception will be thrown in case no suitable Provisioner was yet implemented).

## Building Intersmash

* Simple build, will build `deployments` as well, e.g.: the WildFly deployments that are used by the `testsuite` with default - i.e. _community_ artifacts:
```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

* By activating the `wildfly-deployments-build.eap`, the WildFly deployments will instead be built by using productised bits configuration:
```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pwildfly-deployments-build.eap
```

## Running the Intersmash test suite

* Run the testsuite against community deliverables, e.g.: Keycloak operator or WildFly images:
```shell
mvn test -pl testsuite/ -Pts.community
```
This is usually executed to test community images, deliverables and - for application servers like WildFly - deployments built from community artifacts.

* Run the testsuite against productised deliverables, e.g.: Red Hat Single Sign On operator or JBoss EAP images:
```shell
mvn test -pl testsuite/ -Pts.prod
```
This is usually executed to test productised images, deliverables and - for application servers like JBoss EAP - deployments built from community artifacts.

## Building blocks

Intersmash has been designed to provide components that interact in the context of a testing workflow in order to:

1. provision a products' stack environment, i.e. the _scenario_
2. execute tests in order to validate the behavior of the _scenario_

There are three main components on which such design relies on:

* _annotations_: to describe the scenario - and the services it's made of - directly where it's needed, i.e. on the test class declaration
  
* _applications_: to describe a given service that belongs to a scenario, in terms of configuration and specific properties  

* _provisioners_: to take care of and control the specific workflow that needs to be executed for the given products that a scenario consists of. See [the Intersmash provisioning documentation](./tools/intersmash-tools-provisioners/README.md) to learn about supported  services provisioners.  

## Configuration
* Intersmash is using [XTF](https://github.com/xtf-cz/xtf) to communicate with OpenShift cluster for the OpenShift cloud
  environment.
  The [XTFConfig](https://github.com/xtf-cz/xtf/blob/master/core/src/main/java/cz/xtf/core/config/XTFConfig.java) class
  is also used internally, properties are resolved as following: System Properties > Environment Properties >
  test.properties file > global-test.properties, see https://github.com/xtf-cz/xtf#configuration for more details on this.

* The following properties can be used to configure Intersmash build and test execution, see the [CI checks e2e tests 
script](.ci/openshift-ci/build-root/e2e-test-prod.sh) as an example:

[*] - When `intersmash.skip.deploy` is set, please take into account that the prepared environment should be
configured accordingly to the `Application` descriptors which are defined by the test class `@Service` annotations.
E.g.: if a test class defines an `WildflyOperatorApplication` as one of its services, and such application sets the `name`
to be "wildfly-operator-app", then a Wildfly operator application with such a name should exist in the prepared environment.
This feature is useful to save debugging time during development, where you can deploy a complex scenario and then
enable the property to just execute tests in the following runs.

## Platforms

* Although Intersmash is designed to allow executions on different platforms, at the moment we fully focus on OpenShift
  support.

* Intersmash Framework tooling modules support Java 11 language features, and the compiled code is set to be compliant with
  such version as well.

## Architecture

The Intersmash repository hosts several modules which are meant to provide core APIs (`tools/intersmash-tools-core`),
tooling implementation (`tools/intersmash-tools-provisioners`), shared deployments
(`deployments`), a testsuite (`testsuite`) and examples (`demos`).

### Modules

* **Tools (tools)** - set of core components for platform configuration and application deployment.
  * **intersmash-tools-core** - core interfaces, annotations and extensions.
  * **intersmash-tools-provisioners** - implementations of interfaces from `core` for selected 
    services.
* **Testsuite** - tests that verify the integration with OpenShift, hence a cluster is needed.  
* **Deployments (deployments)** - sources for shared deployments which are used by the testsuite.
  Moreover, the `intersmash-deployments-provider` submodule provides support to get path to compiled deployments. Or
  you can get any deployment by GAV.
* **Demos** - examples that illustrate how to integrate Intersmash.

## Sources and Javadoc artifacts

The Intersmash tooling modules are configured to generate both sources and Javadoc JAR artifacts each time they're 
built.

The `doc` profiles must be activated in order to produce the sources and Javadoc artifacts, e.g.:

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pdoc
```

a new directory, namely `apidocs`, will be generated inside the `target` directory of both `intersmash-tools-core` and 
`intersmash-tools-provisioners`, and HTML files containing the Javadoc will be added to it.

Besides, two additional artifacts will be generated alongside with the usual ones, i.e. the _sources_ and _Javadoc_ 
artifacts. For instance, for `intersmash-tools-provisioner` we'd have the following artifacts generated:

* intersmash-tools-provisioners-_&lt;version&gt;_.jar - Actual provisioners implementation
* intersmash-tools-provisioners-_&lt;version&gt;_-sources.jar - Unzip to get the sources or use in your IDE
* intersmash-tools-provisioners-_&lt;version&gt;_-javadoc.jar - unzip to get Javadoc

## Publishing Intersmash Library artifacts

The Intersmash Library project is configured to publish some artifacts on public Maven repository, so that external 
projects can depend on them, e.g.: the `intersmash-tools-core.jar` artifact which contains the `@Intersmash` annotation 
definition.

Just run:

```shell
mvn clean deploy -DskipTests 
```
